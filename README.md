# Python School Projects

Hi, and thank you for visiting my collection of simple Python school projects!  
Clark Kent’s pal, Elin, will be thrilled to have you here.

In this repository, you’ll find a variety of small, fun, and random programs I created as part of my schoolwork.

## Project List

1. [Simple Q&A Program](https://github.com/eriimarie/school_python_projects/blob/main/SimpleQAProject.py)
2. [Simple Price Calculator Program](https://github.com/eriimarie/school_python_projects/blob/main/SimplePriceCalculator.py)
3. [Simple Neural Simulation Program](https://github.com/eriimarie/school_python_projects/blob/main/SimpleNeuralSim%20.ipynb)
4. [Simple Temperature Calculator](https://github.com/eriimarie/school_python_projects/blob/main/SimpleTemperatureCalculator.py)
5. [Simple  Scope Example Program ](https://github.com/eriimarie/school_python_projects/blob/main/Simplescopeexample.py)
6. [Simple Scope Test Program](https://github.com/eriimarie/school_python_projects/blob/main/SimpleScopeTest.py)

## Files for Download

These Python files are part of a simple brain simulation project.  
**Note:** The full brain simulation file is over 25GB, so it's recommended to download and run it locally.

7. [Simple Brain Simulation - File 1: Half of the Brain](https://github.com/eriimarie/school_python_projects/blob/main/SimpleBrainSim_1.py)  
8. [Simple Brain Simulation - File 2: Full Brain](https://github.com/eriimarie/school_python_projects/blob/main/SimpleBrainSim_2.py)

## Data Visualization and Math Programs (Q&A Style)

This section contains project-based assignments focused on Q&A-style analysis, data visualization, and math programs using Python.

### Project Links
9. [Project Assignment 1 - Simple Math Identity Program](https://github.com/eriimarie/school_python_projects/blob/main/Project_assignment_1.ipynb)  
    A fun math logic exercise! This program prompts for a number, adds 2, multiplies by 3, subtracts 6, and divides by 3—returning you right back to where you started. A clean intro to arithmetic operations and user input in Python.
10. [Project Assignment 2 - Ramen Ratings Analysis](https://github.com/eriimarie/school_python_projects/blob/main/Project_assignment_2_Ramen.ipynb)  
    A tasty data viz project! This one digs into Ramen ratings by:
    - Plotting how many ratings each country received.
    - Grouping by country to find the average rating, then visualizing it in descending order.
    - Creating a pie chart to show how much each brand contributes to the total ratings.
      ** Simple, visual, and just a lil' spicy.**
11. [Project Assignment 3 - Netflix Titles Release Comparison](https://github.com/eriimarie/school_python_projects/blob/main/Project_assignment_3_Netflix.ipynb)  
    This project visualizes how Netflix title releases have changed over time across five countries: Korea, Japan, China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.  
    - A line chart compares the number of titles per year for each country.
    - Uses matplotlib to build a clean, labeled visualization.
    - Simple but insightful way to analyze media trends across regions.
