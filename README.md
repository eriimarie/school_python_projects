# Python School Projects

Hi, and thank you for visiting my collection of simple Python school projects!  
Clark Kent’s pal, Elin, will be thrilled to have you here.

In this repository, you’ll find a variety of small, fun, and random programs I created as part of my schoolwork.

5. [Simple  Scope Example Program ](https://github.com/eriimarie/school_python_projects/blob/main/Simplescopeexample.py)
6. [Simple Scope Test Program](https://github.com/eriimarie/school_python_projects/blob/main/SimpleScopeTest.py)

## Files for Download

These Python files are part of a simple brain simulation project.  
**Note:** The full brain simulation file is over 25GB, so it's recommended to download and run it locally.

7. [Simple Brain Simulation - File 1: Half of the Brain](https://github.com/eriimarie/school_python_projects/blob/main/SimpleBrainSim_1.py)  
8. [Simple Brain Simulation - File 2: Full Brain](https://github.com/eriimarie/school_python_projects/blob/main/SimpleBrainSim_2.py)

## Data Visualization and Math Programs (Q&A Style)

This section contains project-based assignments focused on Q&A-style analysis, data visualization, and math programs using Python.

### Project Links
9. [Project Assignment 1 - Simple Math Identity Program](https://github.com/eriimarie/school_python_projects/blob/main/Project_assignment_1.ipynb)  
    A fun math logic exercise! This program prompts for a number, adds 2, multiplies by 3, subtracts 6, and divides by 3—returning you right back to where you started. A clean intro to arithmetic operations and user input in Python.
10. [Project Assignment 2 - Ramen Ratings Analysis](https://github.com/eriimarie/school_python_projects/blob/main/Project_assignment_2_Ramen.ipynb)  
    A tasty data viz project! This one digs into Ramen ratings by:
    - Plotting how many ratings each country received.
    - Grouping by country to find the average rating, then visualizing it in descending order.
    - Creating a pie chart to show how much each brand contributes to the total ratings.
      ** Simple, visual, and just a lil' spicy.**
11. [Project Assignment 3 - Netflix Titles Release Comparison](https://github.com/eriimarie/school_python_projects/blob/main/Project_assignment_3_Netflix.ipynb)  
    This project visualizes how Netflix title releases have changed over time across five countries: Korea, Japan, China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.  
    - A line chart compares the number of titles per year for each country.
    - Uses matplotlib to build a clean, labeled visualization.
    - Simple but insightful way to analyze media trends across regions.
12. [Project Assignment 4 - Boolean Logic and Loops](https://github.com/eriimarie/school_python_projects/blob/main/Project_assignment_4_boolean.ipynb)  
    This project dives into **Boolean logic** and **looping** mechanics, including:
    - Comparing logic between two Boolean expressions.
    - Counting odd and even numbers from 2 to 25 and squaring them.
    - Rewriting `for` loops as `while` loops for deeper understanding.
    - Cleaning up code by removing unnecessary `break` and `continue` statements.
    - A final user-input program that uses a `while` loop to continuously collect and sum user-entered values.
13. [Project Assignment 5 - Math and Loops](https://github.com/eriimarie/school_python_projects/blob/main/Project_assignment_5_math.ipynb)  
    This project focuses on **mathematical concepts** and **loop operations**, including:
    - Printing and counting all three-digit numbers divisible by 17.
    - Creating conditional logic to check divisibility without a remainder.
    - Writing `for` loops to output specific letters like "A", "P", "I", "L".
    - Looping through a string using `range()` and understanding string indexing.
    - Exploring variable assignments and predicting loop outcomes.
14.  [Project Final Assignment 6 - Data Visualization & World Happiness Analysis](https://github.com/eriimarie/school_python_projects/blob/main/Project_final_assignment_6_dv.ipynb)  
    This final project explores the **World Happiness Report** dataset through a series of Python-based visualizations. The dataset includes variables like:
    
    - Country Name  
    - Region  
    - Ladder Score  
    - Social Support  
    - Healthy Life Expectancy  
    - Log GDP per Capita  
    - Freedom to Make Life Choices  
    - Generosity  
    - Perception of Corruption  

    Visualizations created include:  
    - **Heatmaps** for correlation analysis  
    - **Scatter plots**, **line charts**, and **bar graphs**  
    - **Seaborn pair plots** and **grids** to analyze patterns across countries  
    - **Circle plots** to represent distribution of happiness scores  

    The project showcases real-world data analysis and how visual storytelling can help us understand what makes a country "happy."
